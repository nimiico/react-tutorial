# 01-PURE REACT

- components in react is similar to function with uppercase

- react.dev # react documentation

## Setting up New React Project

1. create react app -> everything is already cinfigured (ESLint, Prettier, ...) \* do not use for real world app because it is out dated technology (good for learning and experiment)
2. Vite -> need to manually set Eslint, ... _ Modern Build Tool _ use for real world app \* extremly fast

- use NEXT.js or Remix framework to build new projects
- next.js use for routing, data fetching and service side rendering. (things that react does not provide easily)

- npx create-react-app@<version> <app-name> # create react app
- npm start # open local page
